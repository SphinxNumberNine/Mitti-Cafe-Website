              We are proud to share that throughout the recent COVID-19
              lockdown, our employees with disabilities have cooked and served
              over 4 lakh meals with drinking water to feed 3,500 daily wage
              workers and homeless people, daily.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the COVID-19 lockdown has made supporting our disabled
              staff very difficult. Most of our disabled employees come from
              low-income backgrounds and extreme poverty. They are often the
              only earning members of their families.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              Even through these difficult times, they havenâ€™t hesitated to take
              care of those in need. Help support our disabled heroes. *Donate
